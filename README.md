# SOS_2023
All projects are done under my Summer of Science 2023 course "Neural netowrks and Deep Learning" which was organized by the Maths and Physics CLub

1. MNIST_Digit_Identification.ipynb:
This notebook contains the project for digit identification on the MNIST dataset. I achieved an accuracy of 98.94% on the dataset

2. CatDogClassifier.ipynb:
This notebook is about the project for classification of cats vs dogs, trained on the cats_vs_dogs by tensorflow. I achieved 79.55% accuracy in this

3. ISR_with_Pixel_Shuffle.ipynb:
This notebook is the implementation of Sub-Pixel CNN with Residual Dense Blocks for image super resolution. I used the PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) metric to measure accuracy and achieved validation loss of 0.0021 and validation PSNR of 25.61. Plus looking at the predictions on the test models, it is evident that the results are quite satisfactory
